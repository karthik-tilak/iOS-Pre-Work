App Idea: 
I have always felt unmotivated to go to the gym alone and find that going with friends always makes it easier for me. So, I want to create Twitch for going to the gym. This app would have livestreams of other content creators going to the gym live when they usually go and the ability to join their stream and do the workout with them. I think following someone else's live routine will help keep users motivated to go to the gym as well. Some features I want to implement are a vertical scrolling feature with recommended streamers as well as a way to customize the look of your app while you work out. Additionally, integrating a way to listen to music during the stream would be an interesting feature.  
    
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I faced were the syntax of Swift as well as figuring out how to customize features of the labels and buttons in the attributes inspector.
